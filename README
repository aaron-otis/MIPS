Lab 2: MIPS operation, Indexing, Creation of Functions Using the Stack

Authors: Aaron, Matt, and Jordan

The goal of this lab was to create Functions (MIPS assembler subroutines) that 
assume arguments (parameters) in registers. The MIPS assembler subroutines
that were created were: 

1. A function ‘bintohex’ to Convert a Binary number to a Hexadecimal
null-terminated string
2. A recursive function that computes the Fibonacci value.
3. A function to implement Indexing and Looping by adding values from a table.
4. A double fixed-point arithmetic add
5. A function that uses Shift instructions to select fields.

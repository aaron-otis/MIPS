Lab 2: MIPS operation, Indexing, Creation of Functions Using the Stack

Authors: Aaron, Matt, and Jordan

The goal of this lab was to create functions (MIPS assembler subroutines)
which assume arguments (parameters) to be in registers. The MIPS assembler 
subroutines that were created were: 

1. A function ‘bintohex’ to convert a binary number to a hexadecimal
   null-terminated string
2. A recursive function that computes the Fibonacci value.
3. A function to implement indexing and looping by adding values from a table.
4. A double fixed-point arithmetic add
5. A function that uses shift instructions to select fields.
